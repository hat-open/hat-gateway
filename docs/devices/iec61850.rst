Gateway events
''''''''''''''

Events registered by gateway have event type starting with::

    gateway/iec61850_client/<device_name>/gateway/...

Available gateway events are:

    * .../status

        Represents change in connection status. Upon enabling device,
        new ``CONNECTING`` status should be registered. Once device is
        disabled, ``DISCONNECTED`` status should be assumed regardless
        of last registered `status` event (registration of
        ``DISCONNECTED`` status event during device disabling is mandatory
        but should not be relied upon).

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec61850.yaml#/$defs/events/client/gateway/status``.

    * .../data/<data_name>

        Represents data received as part of IEC61850 report.

        Source timestamp is dependent on existence of IEC61850 time.
        If IEC61850 time is not available, source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec61850.yaml#/$defs/events/client/gateway/data``.

    * .../command/<command_name>

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec61850.yaml#/$defs/events/client/gateway/command``.

    * .../change/<value_name>

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec61850.yaml#/$defs/events/client/gateway/change``.


System events
'''''''''''''

Events registered by other Hat components, which are consumed by gateway, have
event type starting with::

    gateway/iec61850_client/<device_name>/system/...

Available system events are:

    * .../command/<command_name>

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec61850.yaml#/$defs/events/client/system/command``.

    * .../change/<value_name>

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec61850.yaml#/$defs/events/client/system/change``.
