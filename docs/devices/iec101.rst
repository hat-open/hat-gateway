IEC 60870-5-101 devices
=======================

Together with IEC101 specific events, generic `enable` and `running` events
are also supported.


Master device
-------------

IEC101 master device configuration is specified by
``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/master``.

According to :ref:`gateway specification <gateway>`, all IEC101 master device
event types have prefix::

    'gateway', <gateway_name>, 'iec101_master', <device_name>, <source>, ...

.. todo::

    * create master loop (open serial endpoint) (serial port reconnect delay)
    * enable/disable remote device (query last state on enable device and
      listen for changes)
    * reconnect procedure when serial endpoint available and remote
      device is enabled (remote device reconnect delay)
    * iec101 messages are sent to device only as reaction to `system` events
    * only "automatic" driver action is reconnect loop
    * new `gateway` events are generated only as reaction to:
        - receiving iec101 messages
        - change of connection state
    * messages with test flag are ignored

To enable communication between device and rest of the hat system, following
event types are used:

    * 'gateway', <gateway_name>, 'iec101_master', <device_name>, 'gateway', ...

        * ..., 'status'

            Represents change in serial endpoint status. Upon enabling device,
            new ``CONNECTING`` status should be registered, and ``CONNECTED``
            once serial endpoint is opened. Once device is disabled,
            ``DISCONNECTED`` status should be assumed regardless of last
            registered `status` event (registration of ``DISCONNECTED`` status
            event during device disabling is mandatory but should not be relied
            upon).

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/status``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'status'

            Represents change in remote device connection status. Once serial
            endpoint is opened and remote device enabled, new ``CONNECTING``
            status should be registered. Once device is disabled or remote
            device is disabled, ``DISCONNECTED`` status should be
            assumed regardless of last registered `status` event (registration
            of ``DISCONNECTED`` status event during device disabling or remote
            device disabling is mandatory but should not be relied upon).

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/status``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'data', <asdu_address>, <io_address>

            Represents received IEC101 data message.

            Source timestamp is dependent on existence of IEC101 time.
            If IEC101 time is not available, source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/data``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'command', <asdu_address>, <io_address>

            Represents received IEC101 command message.

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/command``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'interrogation', <asdu_address>

            Represents received IEC101 end of interrogation message.

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/interrogation``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'counter_interrogation', <asdu_address>

            Represents received IEC101 end of counter interrogation message.

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/counter_interrogation``.

    * 'gateway', <gateway_name>, 'iec101_master', <device_name>, 'system', ...

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'enable'

            Represents request for enable/disable remote device.

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/enable``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'command', <asdu_address>, <io_address>

            Represents request for command execution.

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/command``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'interrogation', <asdu_address>

            Represents request for interrogation.

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/interrogation``.

        * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'counter_interrogation', <asdu_address>

            Represents request for counter interrogation.

            Source timestamp is ``None``.

            Payload is specified by
            ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/counter_interrogation``.

    * what to do when cause is None (discard message or return None cause)
    * should we add data_type/command_type to event type
