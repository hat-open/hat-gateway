IEC 60870-5-101 devices
=======================

Together with IEC101 specific events, generic `enable` and `running` events
are also supported.

Supported data types (<data_type>):

    * 'single'
    * 'double'
    * 'step_position'
    * 'bitstring'
    * 'normalized'
    * 'scaled'
    * 'floating'
    * 'binary_counter'
    * 'protection'
    * 'protection_start'
    * 'protection_command'
    * 'status'

Supported command types (<command_type>):

    * 'single'
    * 'double'
    * 'regulating'
    * 'normalized'
    * 'scaled'
    * 'floating'
    * 'bitstring'


Master device
-------------

IEC101 master device configuration is specified by
``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/master``.

According to :ref:`gateway specification <gateway>`, all IEC101 master device
event types have prefix::

    'gateway', <gateway_name>, 'iec101_master', <device_name>, <source>, ...

.. todo::

    * create master loop (open serial endpoint) (serial port reconnect delay)
    * enable/disable remote device (query last state on enable device and
      listen for changes)
    * reconnect procedure when serial endpoint available and remote
      device is enabled (remote device reconnect delay)
    * iec101 messages are sent to device only as reaction to `system` events
    * only "automatic" driver action is reconnect loop
    * new `gateway` events are generated only as reaction to:
        - receiving iec101 messages
        - change of connection state
    * messages with test flag are ignored
    * time sync loop for each enabled remote device


Gateway events
''''''''''''''

Events registered by gateway have event type starting with::

    'gateway', <gateway_name>, 'iec101_master', <device_name>, 'gateway', ...

Available gateway events are:

    * ..., 'status'

        Represents change in serial endpoint status. Upon enabling device,
        new ``CONNECTING`` status should be registered, and ``CONNECTED``
        once serial endpoint is opened. Once device is disabled,
        ``DISCONNECTED`` status should be assumed regardless of last
        registered `status` event (registration of ``DISCONNECTED`` status
        event during device disabling is mandatory but should not be relied
        upon).

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/status``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'status'

        Represents change in remote device connection status. Once serial
        endpoint is opened and remote device enabled, new ``CONNECTING``
        status should be registered. Once device is disabled or remote
        device is disabled, ``DISCONNECTED`` status should be
        assumed regardless of last registered `status` event (registration
        of ``DISCONNECTED`` status event during device disabling or remote
        device disabling is mandatory but should not be relied upon).

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/status``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'data', <data_type>, <asdu_address>, <io_address>

        Represents received IEC101 data message.

        Source timestamp is dependent on existence of IEC101 time.
        If IEC101 time is not available, source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/data``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'command', <command_type>, <asdu_address>, <io_address>

        Represents received IEC101 command message.

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/command``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'interrogation', <asdu_address>

        Represents received IEC101 interrogation activation message.

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/interrogation``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'counter_interrogation', <asdu_address>

        Represents received IEC101 counter interrogation activation message.

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/gateway/counter_interrogation``.


System events
'''''''''''''

Events registered by other Hat components, which are consumed by gateway, have
event type starting with::

    'gateway', <gateway_name>, 'iec101_master', <device_name>, 'system', ...

Available system events are:

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'enable'

        Represents request for enable/disable remote device.

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/enable``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'command', <command_type>, <asdu_address>, <io_address>

        Represents request for command execution.

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/command``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'interrogation', <asdu_address>

        Represents interrogation response message.

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/interrogation``.

    * ..., 'remote_device', <device_address>, 'counter_interrogation', <asdu_address>

        Represents counter interrogation response message.

        Source timestamp is ``None``.

        Payload is specified by
        ``hat-gateway://iec101.yaml#/definitions/events/master/system/counter_interrogation``.
